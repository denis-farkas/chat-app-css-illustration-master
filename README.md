## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

How to apply a shape at the back of others elements with element::before, z-index and position absolute. A little animation fade-in added on messages, not really nice. I'll try other animation in the future.
